# Fine-tuning-LLM
This repository contains code and experiments for fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) using the **Cynaptics dataset**.  
The training was implemented in Python using [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) and PyTorch.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Fine-tuned a pretrained LLM for domain-specific tasks.
- Implemented with Hugging Face `Trainer` API.
- Supports saving, reloading, and pushing models to the Hugging Face Hub.
